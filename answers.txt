What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge takes the changes of one branch and combines it into another branch. Rebase changes the point at which you branched to a later point, thus integrating changes from one branch to another. Rebase also rewrites the history which can be helpful in streamlining; on the other hand, merge preserves a complete and chronological history.

What is a remote repository?

A version of the project that is kept on the Internet/network, not on your local device.
